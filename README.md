# Overview

This is a machine learning model that I created to predict the outcome of NBA games. It uses a dataset containing statistics from every game from 2004-2022. The goal of this project was to test whether or not, given statistics, the model could tell who won each game.

Future work on this model will include a system by which the model predicts games before they happen, given average stats from recent games.

# Development Environment

I coded this projcet using a jupyter notebook and python in VScode.

I also used scikit learn, pandas, and matplot as libraries

# Future Work

- Add new model that can predict future games based off of teams average statisticts.
- Add more information to the dataset incluing more advances stats
